# About
A place for ‚ú®üë®‚Äçüî¨ personal exploration üë©‚Äçüî¨‚ú® of best practices for Compose, design systems, testing, modularization, linting & enforcement of best practices, Gradle config, build speeds, CI, etc.


## Repo structure
This is a Gradle monorepo containing multiple apps (see [apps/](apps)) and common modules shared between them (see [common/](common/)), mainly to allow me to amortize the cost of project setup, in a way that I can easily maintain (Gradle, design system, test infra, CI, etc.)

To view in Android Studio, open the root `build.gradle` file. Then, choose the app you want to run and hit play.

## Apps

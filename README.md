# About
A place for ‚ú®üë®‚Äçüî¨ personal exploration üë©‚Äçüî¨‚ú® of best practices for Compose, design systems, testing, modularization, linting & enforcement of best practices, Gradle config, build speeds, CI, etc.


## Repo structure
This is a Gradle monorepo containing multiple apps (see `apps/`), mainly to allow me to amortize the cost of project setup, in a way that I can easily maintain (Gradle, design systems, etc.)

To view in Android Studio, open the root `build.gradle` file. Then, choose the app you want to run and hit play.

## Sample apps
- **Compose Commerce** - (Module: `:apps:compose-commerce:app`) - An online shopping app that integrates with the [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com) API.
- **Compose Search** - (Module: `:apps:compose-search:app`) A simple single-screen app that allows you to search / filter a list of items. A small sample showing Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) via MVI, including tests.

## Modules
This is a Gradle monorepo, with many modules:

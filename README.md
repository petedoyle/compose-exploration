# About
A place for ‚ú®üë®‚Äçüî¨ personal exploration üë©‚Äçüî¨‚ú® of best practices for Compose, design systems, testing, modularization, linting & enforcement of best practices, Gradle config, build speeds, CI, etc.

I experiment here before subjecting teammates to the bleeding edge.

This is a monorepo containing multiple apps, mainly to allow me to amortize the cost of project setup over multiple projects, in a way that I can easily maintain (Gradle, design systems, etc.)

## Sample apps
- **Compose Movie Search** - (Module: `:apps:compose-movie-search:app`) A simple single-screen app that allows you to search / filter a list of movies. A small sample showing Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) via MVI, including tests.
- **Compose Commerce** - (Module: `:apps:compose-commerce:app`) - An online shopping app that integrates with the [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com) API.

## Modules
This is a Gradle monorepo, with many modules:

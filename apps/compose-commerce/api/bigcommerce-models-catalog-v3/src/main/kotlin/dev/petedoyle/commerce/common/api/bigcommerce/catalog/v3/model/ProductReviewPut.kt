Each variant can have a unique SKU.  Modifiers represent a choice a customer makes about a product that doesn't represent a physical item, i.e. text to be printed on a t-shirt. Assigning a SKU to a modifier will turn it into a variant.  See [Variant Options](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/catalog/products-overview#variant-options) and [Modifier Options](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/catalog/products-overview#modifier-options) for more information.  ## Available Endpoints | Resource / Endpoint                     | Description                                                             | |-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Brand Images                            | Create and manage brand images                                          | | Brand Metafields                        | Create and manage brand metafields                                      | | Brands                                  | Create and manage brands                                                | | Catalog                                 | Create and manage store categories, products, and brands                | | Categories                              | Create and manage categorties                                           | | Category Images                         | Create and manage category images                                       | | Category Metafields                     | Create and manage category metafields                                   | | Product Bulk Pricing Rules              | Create and manage product bulk pricing rules                            | | Product Complex Rules                   | Create and manage product complex rules                                 | | Product Custom Fields                   | Create and manage product custom fields                                 | | Product Images                          | Create and manage product images                                        | | Product Metafields                      | Create and manage product meta fields                                   | | Product Modifier Images                 | Create and manage product modifer images                                | | Product Modifier Values                 | Create and manage product modifier values                               | | Product Modifiers                       | Create and manage product midifiers                                     | | Product Reviews                         | Create and manage product reviews                                       | | Product Variant Option Values           | Create and manage product variant option values                         | | Product Variant Options                 | Create and manage product variant options                               | | Product Variants                        | Create and manage product variants                                      | | Product Videos                          | Create and manage product videos                                        | | Products                                | Create and manage products                                              | | ProductVariant Metafields               | Create and manage product meta flields                                  | | Variants                                | Get and update all variants                                             |  ## Resources  ### Webhooks * [Products](/api-docs/store-management/webhooks/events#products) * [Categories](/api-docs/store-management/webhooks/events#category) * [SKU](/api-docs/store-management/webhooks/events#sku)
